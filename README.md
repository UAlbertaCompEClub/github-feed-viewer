# Github Feed Viewer

## About
Created for the 2015 CompE Hackathon @ Startup Edmonton then adapted for HackED Fall 2016, displays a live updating feed of commits from repos specified in js file. 

Ideal for runnning on a projector so everyone can see how bad of a coder you are.

## Instructions
Here's how to get this running for the upcoming HackEd event.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a `token.js` file. Copy paste the contents of the `sample-token.js` and add your own Github [authentication token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
3. Update the `config.js` file with the current event title, the event deadline and links to the participants' Github repos. 
4. Open up the `index.html` file in your browser, hook it up to a projector and you're good to go! Happy HackEd hacking!
